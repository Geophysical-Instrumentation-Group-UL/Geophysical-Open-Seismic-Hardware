**Homemade librairy to configure ad7768 with Arduino SPI**

This librairy is adapted from the original ad7768 librairy from [Analog device ad7768](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/no-OS/blob/master/drivers/adc/ad7768/ad7768.c). It implements the same logic but adapted with he Arduino SPI function.

All functions are based on a _ad7768_chip_ object:

    typedef struct {
        ad7768_chip_select_pin chipSelectPin = 10; //teensy 4.0 CS pin
        ad7768_power_mode	power_mode;
        ad7768_mclk_div		mclk_div;
        ad7768_dclk_div		dclk_div;
        ad7768_dec_rate		dec_rate;
        ad7768_filt_type	filt_type;
    } ad7768_chip;

This object contains a list parameters of a type enum. This makes it easier and cleaner when configuring a new chip. For example, in the declaration of a new chip, one can decide to set the power mode to only theses values:

    typedef enum {
        AD7768_ECO = 0,
        AD7768_MEDIAN = 2,
        AD7768_FAST = 3,
    } ad7768_power_mode;

Some functions have a mask input parameter. This allows to write in only a specific part of a registry without changing the already in place values. The function _print_config_ has a stream input parameter. This allows to print the configurations in a specific Serial port. 

A list of the registry address is define in the .h file. Those are taken from the datasheet. This librairy is dependant on the Arduino SPI librairy and Stream librairy only.
