# Open-seismic-electrical-design


This repository contains all the design and librairies files for different printed circuit board (PCB) for the Open-Seismic project developped by GiG at Université Laval. KiCad and altium version are available. The Altium version is replaced by the KiCad so we can pursue our open source\license objective. Here are some images of the WorkerBoard as assembled in early 2022. 

This repo contains also main scripts and basic librairies to control the Teensy 4.0 microcontroller and to programm the AD7768 ADC. This software is part of the Open-seismic project developped by GiG (Geophysics instrumentation Group) at Université Laval. All details about the design rules and larger persective of this software is detailed in the wiki section of this repo. For more informations and questions please contact arnaud.mercier.1@ulaval.ca.
