# Open-seismic-electrical-design


This repository contains all the design and librairies files for different printed circuit board (PCB) for the Open-Seismic project developped by GiG at Universit√© Laval. KiCad and altium version are available. The Altium version is replaced by the KiCad so we can pursue our open source\license objective. Here are some images of the WorkerBoard as assembled in early 2022. For more informations and questions please contact arnaud.mercier.1@ulaval.ca.
